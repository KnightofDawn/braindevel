def segment_dat(cnt, marker_def, ival):
    """Convert a continuous data object to an epoched one.

    Given a continuous data object, a definition of classes, and an
    interval, this method looks for markers as defined in ``marker_def``
    and slices the dat according to the time interval given with
    ``ival`` along the ``timeaxis``. The returned ``dat`` object stores
    those slices and the class each slice belongs to.

    Epochs that are too close to the borders and thus too short are
    ignored.

    If the segmentation does not result in any epochs (i.e. the markers
    in ``marker_def`` could not be found in ``dat``, the resulting
    epo.data will be an empty array.

    This method is also suitable for **online processing**, please read
    the documentation for the ``newsamples`` parameter and have a look
    at the Examples below.

    Parameters
    ----------
    dat : Data
        the data object to be segmented
    marker_def : dict
        The keys are class names, the values are lists of markers
    ival : [int, int]
        The interval in milliseconds to cut around the markers. I.e. to
        get the interval starting with the marker plus the remaining
        100ms define the interval like [0, 100]. The start point is
        included, the endpoint is not (like: ``[start, end)``).  To get
        200ms before the marker until 100ms after the marker do:
        ``[-200, 100]`` Only negative or positive values are possible
        (i.e. ``[-500, -100]``)

    Returns
    -------
    epo : Data
        a copy of the resulting epoched data.

    Raises
    ------
    AssertionError
        * if ``dat`` has not ``.fs`` or ``.markers`` attribute or if
          ``ival[0] > ival[1]``.
