class CSPExperiment(object):
    """
        A Filter Bank Common Spatial Patterns Experiment.

        Parameters
        ----------
        set_loader : Dataset loader
            An object which loads the dataset. 
            Should have a load method which returns a wyrm data object with 
            the continuuous signal.
        cleaner : Cleaning object
            Should have a clean method which accepts the continuuous signal as 
            a wyrm object and returns the rejected chans, rejected trials and
            the clean trials.
        sensor_names : string array
             Names of sensors to use. 
             None implies all sensors.
        resample_fs : float
            The resampling frequency. None means no resampling.
        min_freq : int
            The minimum frequency of the filterbank.
        max_freq : int
            The maximum frequency of the filterbank.
        last_low_freq : int
            The last frequency with the low width frequency of the filterbank.
        low_width : int
            The width of the filterbands in the lower frequencies.
        low_overlap : int
            The overlap of the filterbands in the lower frequencies.
        high_width : int
            The width of the filterbands in the higher frequencies.
        high_overlap : int
            The overlap of the filterbands in the higher frequencies.
        filt_order : int
            The filter order of the butterworth filter which computes the filterbands.
        segment_ival : sequence of 2 floats
            The start and end of the trial in milliseconds with respect to the markers.
        standardize : bool
            Whether to standardize the features of the filterbank before training.
            Will do online standardization, i.e., will compute means and standard
            deviations on the training fold and then compute running means and
            standard deviations going trial by trial through the test fold.
        n_folds : int
            How many folds. Also determines size of the test fold, e.g.
            5 folds imply the test fold has 20% of the original data.
        n_top_bottom_csp_filters : int
            Number of top and bottom CSP filters to select from all computed filters.
            Top and bottom refers to CSP filters sorted by their eigenvalues.
            So a value of 3 here will lead to 6(!) filters.
            None means all filters.
        n_selected_filterbands : int
            Number of filterbands to select for the filterbank.
            Will be selected by the highest training accuracies.
            None means all filterbands.
        n_selected_features : int
            Number of features to select for the filterbank.
            Will be selected by an internal cross validation across feature
            subsets.
            None means all features.
        forward_steps : int
            Number of forward steps to make in the feature selection,
            before the next backward step.
        backward_steps : int
            Number of backward steps to make in the feature selection,
            before the next forward step.
        stop_when_no_improvement: bool
            Whether to stop the feature selection if the interal cross validation
            accuracy could not be improved after an epoch finished
            (epoch=given number of forward and backward steps).
            False implies always run until wanted number of features.
        only_last_fold: bool
            Whether to train only on the last fold. 
            True implies a train-test split, where the n_folds parameter
            determines the size of the test fold.
            Test fold will always be at the end of the data (timewise).
        restricted_n_trials: int
            Take only a restricted number of the clean trials.
            None implies all clean trials.
        common_average_reference: bool
            Whether to run a common average reference on the signal (before filtering).
        ival_optimizer: IvalOptimizer object
            If given, optimize the ival inside the trial before CSP.
            None means use the full trial.
        shuffle: bool
            Whether to shuffle the clean trials before splitting them into folds.
            False implies folds are time-blocks, True implies folds are random
            mixes of trials of the entire file.
        marker_def: dict
            Dictionary mapping class names to marker numbers, e.g.
            {'1 - Correct': [31], '2 - Error': [32]}
